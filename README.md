# Assignment

This project was developed as part of a company assignment. During its creation, I explored and implemented modern web animation techniques using [framer-motion](https://npmjs.com/package/framer-motion), experimented with parallax effects, and enhanced my understanding of interactive UI design. The project demonstrates my ability to learn new libraries and apply advanced animation concepts in a real-world scenario.
